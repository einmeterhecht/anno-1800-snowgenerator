- Make -d flag do something
- Add regex filtering via CLI parameter
- Add saving isometric renderings as CLI parameter
# Adjust isometric rendering to size of building
# Render after snow has been generated
# Don't output success message for every mipmap saved
# Create "Texture" class
# Debug residence_tier01_diff being incorrect
- Do not generate snow on fragments were the geometry is steep (/vertical), but the normal map makes the fragment appear to be inclined almost horizontally
